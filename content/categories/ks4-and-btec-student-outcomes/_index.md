Developing their responses to Stanley Spencer, I encouraged my BTEC students to work collaboratively to produce an inspired mixed media Spencer piece. Using colour pop, we replicated Stanley Spencer's mark making and theme but using a 'colour pop' and black and white theme.

Also featured in this album are examples of two previous students GCSE exam pieces, focussing upon landscapes and environment.
