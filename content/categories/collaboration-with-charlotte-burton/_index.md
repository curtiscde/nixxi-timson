Collaborating with artist Charlotte Burton, we explored the idea of colours in movement and incorporating text with image. This followed a previous exhibition on ekphrasis, the relationship between word and image and this project felt fitting as it signified the ending of that investigation and beginning of a new project exploring colour.
