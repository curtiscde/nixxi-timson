description = 'For a period of time, my work focussed upon the relationship between text and image. Fascinated by the unspoken language of visual art, I leaned away from colour and began exploring monochrome paintings with relating phrases.'

Having Dyslexia and Irlen Syndrome, it baffles some that I would choose to explore text and the use of black and white in my art work. The connection I have with the content of my work really motivated me to explore and delve deeper into my relationship with text, language and writing.

Colour paintings have been produced onto to canvases and some sold to customers or created by commission.
Painting is something I have and will always enjoy. In my professional life, this passion is something I hope to instill in others.
